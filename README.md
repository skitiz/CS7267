# Machine Learning (CS7267)

## Dependencies
* Python
* numpy
* Pandas
* MNIST Dataset

## Homework 1
# K - Nearest Neighbours
We use the MNIST handwritten letters dataset and use KNN to calculate the accuracy of prediction.
_Current accuracy : 90%_

*To run the code :* `python knn.py`

Modify the values of `k` inside to change accuracy levels.
